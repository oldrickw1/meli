                        <p>Moving to a new city or country is very exciting, but you also have to think about a 100 different things to let the move go as smooth as possible.
                            <br><br>

                            One of the main things you need is, of course, a place to stay. It might be quite difficult and daunting to just rent an apartment via the internet without ever seeing it in real life before the actual move. 
                            <br><br>
                            This is where remotehouscheck comes in. I will be your eyes and ears on the ground. Let me help you view your future house. I will take pictures, videos and take a look around the neighborhood so it will just be like you are there.

                            Do you also want a video call during the house check? No problem, I will call you and you can see for yourself in realtime!</p>
                        <div>
                            <p>See your apartment, roommates, neighborhood, talk to the landlord and make sure the apartment looks exactly like the online ad says.

                    <h1>My story</h1>
                    <div class="flex">
                        <p>
                            I had the luxury of checking out apartments in person when I was going on a six month adventure in Spain. <br><br>

                            However, many friends weren't as fortunate, having to rely on online pictures and trust the process from afar. Some were surprised with their new homes as they looked different than in the pictures.<br><br>

                            Fast forward to now, years later in Madrid, I didn‚Äôt have the oppertunity anymore to view my home in person and I also had to trust the process from afar. Luckily this gambling game went well.<br><br>

                            This got me thinking: What if there had been someone to do the viewing for me, taking pictures and videos to confirm it's the real deal? 

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            
                            Imagine if that person could've met my future roommates and given me a little tour down the street and neighbourhood? <br><br>

                            That idea stuck with me, leading me to start doing these viewings for others here in Madrid. It's like they're there without being there!<br><br>

                            I'm looking forward to helping more of you to find a place in Madrid. Whether you're a student settling in for six months or a working professional looking to embrace this fantastic city. I will be your eyes on the ground.<br><br>

                            And who knows, maybe I'll expand to other exciting spots in this great country soon!
